 OKTRIX
"The Next Dimension of Human-Computer Interaction"

Inspiration
For years I've felt that the way we interact with computers has fallen behind.

Technology advances rapidly, but our interaction remains rigid, limited, and impersonal.

I've always wanted to explore a different way of communicating with the digital world, one where the body, space, and intention play a real role.

The CodeSpring Hackathon was the perfect excuse to turn that concern into a working prototype. OKTrix was born as a first step toward a new form of human-computer interaction: freer, more natural, and closer to how we actually move and live.

This project isn't just a technical experiment; it's the beginning of a vision I want to continue developing.

Problem

Human-computer interaction remains trapped in rigid devices that don't adapt to the human body, space, or context.

To use a computer, we must sit still and close to the keyboard and mouse, even though technology could accompany us more freely. This rigidity disrupts the fluidity between intention and action, making interaction with digital technology cold, mechanical, and unnatural.

This problem not only affects everyday experience but also excludes millions of people with mobility limitations, temporary injuries, or physical fatigue, and impacts professionals who spend long hours in front of a screen. Current solutions are often expensive, complex, or require specialized hardware.

There is a clear need for new forms of interaction that restore freedom, accessibility, and naturalness to the relationship between humans and computers, allowing interaction based on movement, distance, and real-world context.

Solution

OKTrix is ​​a universal alternative input platform that democratizes access to technology through computer vision and artificial intelligence, while radically transforming the experience of interacting with computers. It's not simply a gesture control application – it's a new paradigm of human-computer interaction that brings freedom, naturalness, and magic back to our relationship with digital technology.
Using only a standard webcam (no additional hardware), OKTrix allows anyone to control their computer with natural hand gestures from any distance visible to the camera – whether it's 30 cm or 3 meters. The system functions as a modular ecosystem that expands progressively to cover all aspects of PC use: media playback, web browsing, presentations, video/photo/code editing, running custom macros, and window management.
Activation/deactivation is performed with the universal OK gesture "👌" held for 3 seconds, providing complete control over when the system is active. OKTrix translates intuitive movements (like opening your hand in specific directions) into precise operating system actions, physically freeing you from your desktop and allowing you to interact with your computer in ways that previously seemed impossible: control your music while cooking, advance presentation slides by walking across the stage, pause your video while stretching, adjust the volume from the couch.

Beyond functionality, OKTrix creates an immersive experience where your body becomes the remote control, where every gesture feels intentional and satisfying, where technology finally responds to you naturally. It's the difference between "using" a computer and "dialoguing" with it, between a cold tool and a fluid extension of your intentions. OKTrix makes the digital world more human, more beautiful, more free.

Usage Philosophy: OKTrix is ​​not designed to completely replace the keyboard/mouse during continuous use of 8+ hours, but rather to complement it in specific contexts where it provides real value: media control while performing other tasks, presentations where you need to move freely, ergonomic rest periods (active breaks), and especially for users with mobility limitations who have no other options. The system activates/deactivates at will (👌 x 3 sec) precisely for intentional and temporary use, optimizing the experience without causing physical fatigue.

Innovative Features

Scalable Modular Architecture: Unlike point solutions, OKTrix is ​​designed from the ground up as a plugin system where each module (Media, Presentations, Code, Navigation, etc.) can be activated/deactivated independently. This architecture allows for expanding functionality without refactoring existing code, facilitating open-source contributions and user customization. It's not an app; it's a multimodal interaction platform.
