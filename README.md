## Inspiration

**Technology is powerful, but often feels cold and mechanical.**  
Interactions are efficient, yet disconnected from the body.

OKTrix was inspired by a simple question:  
_What if interacting with a computer felt intentional, spatial, and satisfying?_

The goal was not only accessibility or productivity, but restoring **beauty, flow, and physical presence** to digital interaction—using only what we already have: our body.

This project also represents my first year actively participating in hackathons, pushing myself to turn ideas into real, working prototypes under tight constraints.

## What it does

**OKTrix allows users to control their computer using hand and body gestures**, without additional hardware or cloud processing.

It detects gestures in real time and maps them to system-level actions such as navigation, control, and interaction—turning the human body into a natural interface for the digital world.

No extra hardware. No cloud processing. And complete user privacy.

## How we built it

OKTrix is built using a **local-first architecture** focused on performance, privacy, and responsiveness.

Main components include:
- **Real-time computer vision** for gesture detection  
- A **gesture-to-action mapping layer**  
- **On-device processing** to ensure low latency  

All computation runs locally, following the principle:

\\( \text{Low Latency} + \text{Privacy} = \text{Better UX} \\)

## Challenges we ran into

- Maintaining reliable gesture detection under different lighting conditions  
- Balancing sensitivity versus false positives  
- Designing interactions that feel **natural**, not tiring or gimmicky  
- Keeping latency low without relying on cloud services  

Each challenge required fast iteration and careful UX-driven decisions.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- A fully functional gesture-based control system  
- Zero external hardware required  
- No cloud dependency  
- Strong focus on **user experience**, not just technical novelty  
- A solid and extensible foundation for future features  

---

## What we learned

- UX quality matters as much as technical accuracy  
- Removing friction often matters more than adding features  
- Local-first systems can deliver both performance and trust  
- Good interaction design requires thinking beyond screens

## What's next for OKTrix
- Enhance the following execution modules (Presentations, Code, Navigation, Editing, Gaming, Ergonomic Breaks, etc.)
- More customizable gestures  
- Adaptive gesture sensitivity  
- Expanded use cases in education, public spaces, and creative work  

The long-term goal is to redefine how humans physically interact with digital systems.
